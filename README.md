What Is Sticky Session Load Balancing? What Do You Mean By "Session Affinity"?</h2></div> <div data-v-4865b274=""><h3 data-v-4865b274="">Answer:</h3> <div data-v-4865b274=""><div><div><div class="AnswerBody"><p><em>Sticky session</em> or a <em>session affinity technique</em> is another popular load balancing technique that requires a user session to be always served by an allocated machine.  </p><p>In a load balanced server application where user information is stored in session it will be required to keep the session data available to all machines. This can be avoided by always serving a particular user session request from one machine. The machine is associated with a session as soon as the session is created. All the requests in a particular session are always redirected to the associated machine. This ensures the user data is only at one machine and load is also shared.  </p><p>This is typically done by using SessionId cookie. The cookie is sent to the client for the first request and every subsequent request by client must be containing that same cookie to identify the session.  </p><p><strong>What Are The Issues With Sticky Session?</strong></p><p>There are few issues that you may face with this approach  </p><ul><li>The client browser may not support cookies, and your load balancer will not be able to identify if a request belongs to a session. This may cause strange behavior for the users who use no cookie based browsers.</li><li>In case one of the machine fails or goes down, the user information (served by that machine) will be lost and there will be no way to recover user session.</li></ul></div></div><div class="row my-2"><div><span><i>Source:</i>&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.fromdev.com/2013/07/architect-interview-questions-and-answers.html" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" title="What Is Sticky Session Load Balancing?

Fail over is a important technique in achieving high availability. Typically a load balancer is configured to fail over to another machine when the main machine fails.  </p><p>To achieve least down time, most load balancer support a feature of <em>heart beat</em> check. This ensures that target machine is responding. As soon as a hear beat signal fails, load balancer stops sending request to that machine and redirects to other machines or cluster.  </p></div></div><div class="row my-2"><div><span><i>Source:</i>&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.fromdev.com/2013/07/architect-interview-questions-and-answers.html" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" title="What Is Load Balancing Fail Over?

What is the difference between Session Affinity and Sticky Session?</h2></div> <div data-v-4865b274=""><h3 data-v-4865b274="">Answer:</h3> <div data-v-4865b274=""><div><div><div class="AnswerBody"><p><strong>Sticky session</strong> means that when a request comes into a site from a client all further requests go to the same server initial client request accessed. I believe that session affinity is a <strong>synonym</strong> for sticky session, but there are different ways of implementing it:</p><ol><li>Send a cookie on the first response and then look for it on subsequent ones. The cookie says which real server to send to.
<strong>Bad</strong> if you have to support cookie-less browsers</li><li>Partition based on the requester's IP address.
<strong>Bad</strong> if it isn't static or if many come in through the same proxy.</li><li>If you authenticate users, partition based on user name (it has to be an HTTP supported authentication mode to do this).</li><li>Don't require state.
Let clients hit any server (send state to the client and have them send it back)
This is not a sticky session, it's a way to avoid having to do it.</li></ol><p>I would suspect that sticky might refer to the cookie way, and that affinity might refer to #2 and #3 in some contexts, but that's not how I have seen it used (or use it myself).</p></div></div><div class="row my-2"><div><span><i>Source:</i>&nbsp;<span><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1040025/difference-between-session-affinity-and-sticky-session" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" title="What is the difference between Session Affinity and Sticky Session?

What are some variants of Round-Robin Load Balancing algorithm?</h2></div> <div data-v-4865b274=""><h3 data-v-4865b274="">Answer:</h3> <div data-v-4865b274=""><div><div><div class="AnswerBody"><p>The following variants to the round‑robin algorithm take additional factors into account and can result in better load balancing:</p><ul><li><strong>Simple Round-Robin</strong> -  Simplest methods for distributing client requests. It just forwards a client request to each server in turn. When it reaches the end of the list, the load balancer loops back and goes down the list again.</li><li><strong>Weighted Round-Robin</strong>&nbsp;– A weight is assigned to each server based on criteria chosen by the site administrator; the most commonly used criterion is the server’s traffic‑handling capacity. The higher the weight, the larger the proportion of client requests the server receives. If, for example, server&nbsp;A is assigned a weight of 3 and server&nbsp;B a weight of&nbsp;1, the load balancer forwards 3&nbsp;requests to server&nbsp;A for each&nbsp;1 it sends to server&nbsp;B.</li><li><strong>Dynamic Round-Robin</strong>&nbsp;– A weight is assigned to each server dynamically, based on real‑time data about the server’s current load and idle capacity.</li></ul></div></div><div class="row my-2"><div><span><i>Source:</i>&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/round-robin-load-balancing/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" title="What are some variants of Round-Robin Load Balancing algorithm?

What is the Difference Between Weighted Load Balancing vs Round Robin Load Balancing?</h2></div> <div data-v-4865b274=""><h3 data-v-4865b274="">Answer:</h3> <div data-v-4865b274=""><div><div><div class="AnswerBody"><p>The biggest drawback of using the round robin algorithm in load balancing is that the algorithm assumes that servers are similar enough to handle equivalent loads. If certain servers have more CPU, RAM, or other specifications, the algorithm has no way to distribute more requests to these servers. As a result, servers with less capacity may overload and fail more quickly while capacity on other servers lie idle.</p><p><strong>The weighted round robin load balancing algorithm allows site administrators to assign weights to each server based on criteria like traffic-handling capacity</strong>. Servers with higher weights receive a higher proportion of client requests. For a simplified example, assume that an enterprise has a cluster of three servers:</p><ul><li>Server A can handle 15 requests per second, on average</li><li>Server B can handle 10 requests per second, on average</li><li>Server C can handle 5 requests per second, on average</li></ul><p>Next, assume that the load balancer receives 6 requests.</p><ul><li>3 requests are sent to Server A</li><li>2 requests are sent to Server B</li><li>1 request is sent to Server C.</li></ul><p>In this manner, the weighted round robin algorithm distributes the load according to each server’s capacity.</p></div></div><div class="row my-2"><div><span><i>Source:</i>&nbsp;<span><a href="https://avinetworks.com/glossary/round-robin-load-balancing/#:~:text=Round%20robin%20load%20balancing%20is,the%20list%20and%20repeats%20again." rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" title="What is the Difference Between Weighted Load Balancing vs Round Robin Load Balancing?

Explain what is Reverse Proxy Server?</h2></div> <div data-v-4865b274=""><h3 data-v-4865b274="">Answer:</h3> <div data-v-4865b274=""><div><div><div class="AnswerBody"><p><strong>A Reverse Proxy Server</strong>, sometimes also called a reverse proxy web server, often a feature of a load balancing solution, stands between web servers and users, similar to a forward proxy. However, unlike the forward proxy which sits in front of users, guarding their privacy, the reverse proxy sits in front of web servers, and intercepts requests.</p><p>A reverse proxy server acts like a middleman, communicating with the users so the users never interact directly with the origin servers. It also balances client requests based on location and demand, and offers additional security. A reverse proxy cache server can:</p><ul><li>Enhance performance by caching local content</li><li>Disguise the characteristics and existence of origin servers</li><li>Carry TLS acceleration hardware, enabling them to perform TLS encryption in place of secure websites</li><li>Distribute load from incoming requests to each of several servers (load balancing)</li><li>Compress content, optimizing it and speeding loading times</li><li>Perform multivariate testing and A/B testing without inserting JavaScript into pages</li><li>Protection from DDoS attacks and related security issues</li></ul></div></div><div class="row my-2"><div><span><i>Source:</i>&nbsp;<span><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Explain what is Reverse Proxy Server?

What Is IP Address Affinity Technique For Load Balancing?</h2></div> <div data-v-4865b274=""><h3 data-v-4865b274="">Answer:</h3> <div data-v-4865b274=""><div><div><div class="AnswerBody"><p><em>IP address affinity</em> is another popular way to do load balancing. In this approach, the client IP address is associated with a server node. All requests from a client IP address are served by one server node.  </p><p>This approach can be really easy to implement since IP address is always available in a HTTP request header and no additional settings need to be performed. This type of load balancing can be useful if you clients are likely to have disabled cookies.  </p><p>However there is a down side of this approach. If many of your users are behind a NATed IP address then all of them will end up using the same server node. This may cause uneven load on your server nodes. NATed IP address is really common, in fact anytime you are browsing from a office network its likely that you and all your coworkers are using same NATed IP address.  </p></div></div><div class="row my-2"><div><span><i>Source:</i>&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.fromdev.com/2013/07/architect-interview-questions-and-answers.html" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" title="What Is IP Address Affinity Technique For Load Balancing?
